# 🕶️ Virtual Sunglasses Try On

A Python-based virtual try-on project that leverages computer vision and machine learning to overlay sunglasses onto a live webcam feed. This project demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge technologies like MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Pillow for real-time facial landmark detection and augmented reality (AR) effects.

## 🪄 Technologies

- Python: Core programming language.
- OpenCV: For webcam feed capture and image processing.
- MediaPipe: For detecting face landmarks.
- Pillow (PIL): For resizing and overlaying sunglasses with alpha transparency.
- GitHub Pages: Link TBD.

## 🪄 Process

**Input**: Webcam feed or image upload.

**Processing**:
- Detect face and facial landmarks.
- Position sunglasses on the face using keypoints.
  
**Output**: Real-time overlay of virtual sunglasses.

## 🪄  Project Features

- Real-time detection of facial landmarks.
- Dynamic resizing and placement of sunglasses based on face proportions.
- Compatibility with webcam input for live try-on functionality.

## 🪄 Takeaways

- Facial Landmarking: Learn how to use MediaPipe for detecting key points on a face.
- Image Processing: Use OpenCV and Pillow for image manipulation and compositing.
- Augmented Reality Basics: Implement AR-style overlays with transparency.
- Cross-Platform Development: Explore implementation options for desktop and web.

## 🪄 Where It's Applicable

- Virtual try-on for eyewear or other accessories.
- Augmented reality features in e-commerce or retail apps.
- Educational tools for learning computer vision and AR concepts.
